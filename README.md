Richard W Gosse - A00246425

# This project’s overall goal is to create a working model for a decentralized,
# distributed block chain based secure ‘cloud’ file storage application.
# The addition of block chain transactions will allow for network storage
# meta data, such as URLs and access rights, to be secured.
